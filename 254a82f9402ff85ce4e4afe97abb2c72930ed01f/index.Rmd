# Description

This course is mainly designed to introduce students with the use of R language. It will introduce popular R functions to sort, visualize and analyze data in ecology. Broad topics covered will include: introduction to R language and basic functions, data manipulation, graphics, maps, linear model, parametric and non-parametric analysis,  multivariate analysis, etc. 

**Objectives** The aim of this course is for the students to get familiar with R language. This course will explore the multiple advantages of using R language for formatting reports,  preparing presentation, exploring and analyzing ecological, data creating and sharing project. The course will assume that students have no prior knowledge in R or other programming languages. It will start from scratch, **i.e.** downloading R and installing it on your computer. Along the semester, you will be introduced to the use of  [RStudio GUI](https://www.rstudio.com/), [Rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), and [GitHub](https://github.com/) repositories which all improve you Rrrrr experience.


After taking this course, a student should: 

`r knitr::asis_output("\U1F449")` see the multiples advantages of using R; 

`r knitr::asis_output("\U1F449")` not be afraid of using code to organize, visualize and analyze data;

`r knitr::asis_output("\U1F449")` know several statistical tools for the analysis of ecological data in particular;

`r knitr::asis_output("\U1F449")` become a self-learner, able to explore and solve ecological problem;

`r knitr::asis_output("\U1F449")` analyze and valorize scientifically any simple data sets;

`r knitr::asis_output("\U1F449")` be able to help and advices on the use of R


**Requirement** This course requires students to bring/use their own personal computer.


**Disclaimer** Format of this course is largely inspired by online documentation from Fukami T. & Coyle J. (Standford University) and others. Examples used are often famous data set publicly available.

I am not a statistician or a programmer, so I explain with simple words avoiding as much as possible technical jargon. The ultimate aim is more to teach you how to look for relevant information. Don't aim to know everything, but to be able to learn anything.

# Evaluation

All information below may change according to the evolution of the pandemic. Updates will be directly posted here.


**(1)** As long as the class will be online, you will be assigned with a couple of simple exercise to practice what we saw during the class. Practice will make you better, and it is strongly recommended that you  consider those exercises as a priority. Across the lectures, you will find two types of **practical sessions**:

+ The 1st type is highlighted in green


<p class="comment">
**Practice A:** this is a practical session that you should try on your own. You do not have to send me, but you have to make sure you can do it on your own.
</p>


+ The 2nd type is highlighted in red


<p class="alert">
**`r knitr::asis_output("\U26A0")` Practice B:** this is a practical session that I expected you to send the solution on the Monday before the next class. Use [vianneydenis@g.ntu.edu.tw], title of the email should be the name of the practical session **Practice B**. I only accept *.Rmd* and *.html* formats. Therefore, make sure to understand rapidly how to generate those formats using R (see [Introduction](./introduction.html)).</p>


**(2)** If pandemic is getting better and we can eventually start on-site class, one student will be randomly pick up at the beginning of the class in order to summarize  the previous class within 5-10 minutes. Student selected will use *.Rmd* and/or *.html*  for **presentation**. The following R chunk code will make the decision, and you may be picked several time in the semester (lucky) or never (unlucky). Conclusion: *Always be ready*.

```{r,  eval=F}
library(dplyr)
list_student<-c('Student_1','Student_2','Student_3','Student_4')
sample(list_student, 1, replace = TRUE)
```


**(3)** A short (5-10 printed A4 pages max.) **research project** (*.Rmd* and/or *.html*) must be prepared along the semester and will be sent on week before the day of the final exam. Format must follow the format of a scientific publication but with introduction and discussion summarized to the maximum as bullet points. A focus should be given on the methods (data set and analysis) and the results. Because of the pandemic, I will assign you with a data set and a research question. If situation is getting better, you may pick up by yourself a topic of your choice and work on this project as a small group (2-3  people max.) and present your work on the final week. In the latter case, a **small proposal** (1-2 pages, *.Rmd* and/or *.html*) will have to be submitted before mid-term week and are encouraged to develop your own experiment or develop original research question based on already published data sets (avoid topics related to COVID-19 in order to be original, > 50 % of projects last year ). 

<p style="color:red">Final score is typically composed of mid-term  (**30%**), final (**50%**) reports, and others: weekly participation and assignments (**20%**)</p>
